            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Automating processes:</strong> Streamlining workflows that
              are slow, expensive, or difficult to scale using tools like LLMs.

            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Exploring ideas:</strong> Turning "what ifs" into
              prototypes and production-ready products. I help teams figure out
              what’s possible with AI and make it a reality.

              “Our onboarding flow needed to capture user preferences in a
              natural and effective way. Vignesh experimented with generative AI
              approaches and developed a system that turned chatbot
              conversations into structured insights. His work was essential to
              delivering the experience we envisioned.”

              “Our team needed to build a frontend interface for a
              conversational AI application for a large prospective customer on
              a tight timeline. Vignesh stepped in and integrated our chat SDK
              and NLX platform into a solution that could easily be productized.
              The solution worked to specification and was a key part of how we
              showcased our capabilities to the client. His ability to deliver
              under pressure made all the difference.”
