              “Our onboarding flow needed to capture user preferences in a
              natural and effective way. Vignesh experimented with generative AI
              approaches and developed a system that turned chatbot
              conversations into structured insights. His work was essential to
              delivering the experience we envisioned.”

              conversational AI application for a large prospective customer on
              a tight timeline. Vignesh stepped in and integrated our chat SDK
              and NLX platform into a solution that could easily be productized.
              The solution worked to specification and was a key part of how we
              showcased our capabilities to the client. His ability to deliver
              under pressure made all the difference.”
