  <Section title="Background">
    <Prose>
      <p>
        I've partnered with companies in industries including enterprise SaaS,
        consumer social, healthcare, fintech, and crypto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to consulting, I was an early engineer at two AI-driven companies
        that were acquired: <strong>Drift</strong> (conversational AI, acquired by Vista for $1.2B) 
        and <strong>Kensho</strong> (AI for financial services, acquired by S&P Global for $550M).
