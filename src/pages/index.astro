      I'm Vignesh Mohankumar, and Nila is my independent consulting practice. I
      partner with engineering teams to build AI features and automations—either
      through advisory, where I help with architecture and coach staff engineers
      to ship effectively, or through hands-on implementation.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
      I also teach
